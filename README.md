## Who is this monkey?
`<monkey credit>`<br/>
I've borrowed this beautiful monkey from [Wait but Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) which is my favorite place in the entire internet. 
It is called the instant gratification monkey and you can [read all about him](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) 
or [watch the Ted talk about him](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator/up-next) if you're interested.
